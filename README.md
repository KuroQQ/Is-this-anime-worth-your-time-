The following is a remix of an early project made in my Freshman year of college nicely called "Is this Anime worth your time"

We all have sometimes seen clips and screenshots from anime that have not been posted and we may find them interesting.
My application was made to help actually determine if that anime you saw 2 seconds of is actually worth your time in the end.
The application take screenshots from anime and runs them through the trace moe API which will determine what anime it is.
From that API it will then go into Jikan to determine if the Anime that was listed is "Kino" or "Slop".
